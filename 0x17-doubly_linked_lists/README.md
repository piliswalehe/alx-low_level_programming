### Doubly linked list

- this is a type of data structure used in to store a collection of elements. 
- Each element in a doubly linked list is called a node and contains not only the
data but also references or pointers to the previous and next nodes in the sequence.

## Characteristics of a doubly linked list

- Each node contains data and two pointers: one pointing to the previous node and another pointing to the next node.
- The list has a reference to the first node called the head and a reference to the last node called the tail.
- It allows traversal in both forward and backward directions, as each node has pointers to both its previous and next nodes.
